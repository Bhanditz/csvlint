Feature: CSV Validation
  In order to make sure my CSV files are usable by others
  As a data publisher
  I want to make sure that my CSV files are valid
  
  Background:
    Given the fixture "csvs/test.csv" is available at the URL "http://example.org/test.csv"
    
  Scenario: Enter a URL for validation
    When I go to the homepage
    And I enter "http://example.org/test.csv" in the "url" field
    And I press "Validate"
    Then I should see a page of validation results
